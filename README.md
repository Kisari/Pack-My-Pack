# Arduino-Project
This **React Native** app, built with **Expo**, integrates with **Arduino hardware** to provide a weather-responsive wardrobe selection system. The app monitors real-time weather conditions and user preferences to recommend suitable items like a phone, raincoat, or other essentials.

Users simply open the app, view recommendations based on weather or day, and press "Start." The Arduino-controlled mechanism rotates the closet to the suggested item, making it quick and effortless for the user to grab and go.

The app also includes basic functions for users to add new items to the closet, as well as remove, filter, and search for items.

This project combines IoT and mobile technology to streamline daily routines with a smart and interactive experience.
